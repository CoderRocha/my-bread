# myBread

"myBread" is a simple app project created by me, Guilherme Rocha, to understand more the process of creating a React Application from the ground up, utilizing many of the React features, such as "React Hooks", and more about realtime databases using 'Firebase'.

# How to run the app correctly?

After you download and extract all the source code on the zip file to it's own folder, you can run the following commands in order on the project directory terminal to install the necessary dependencies to run the application without any issues:

### `npm install`

After the installation, you need to install a specific 'Firebase' version, so the 'Realtime Database' works properly.
Run the following command to install the correct version for this project:

### `npm install firebase@8.5`

After both installations, to run the React application, you need to run the following command in a terminal:

### `npm run start`

And then, access the application in the following local URL:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The project is about a simple app...
